## Farm Trace

This code aims to revolutionize agriculture supply chain.


### Problem statement:


1) Inefficiencies - Traditional agricultural supply chain is inefficient because it leads to delayed transactions and financial losses for farmers.
2) Lack of transparency - Consumers are unable to know the origin and quality of their food.
3) Fair compensation - Farmers face challenges when receiving their fair compensation due to intermediaries.


### Solution:


1) Transparent supply chain - Blockchain is used to create a transparent ledger for every transaction within the supply chain, thus consumers can ensure authenticity and quality.
2) Efficient transactions - Eliminating intermediaries leads to cost savings and fair compensation for farmers.
3) Fair compensation mechanism - Empowering farmers with a platform that ensures they receive fair value for their hard work.
